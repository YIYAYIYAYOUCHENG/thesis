	of component-based real-time systems. In our model, a component consists
	of a set of concurrent real-time threads that communicate by means
	of synchronous and asynchronous operations. In addition, each component
	can specify its own local scheduling algorithm. We also discuss the
	support that must be provided at the operating system level, and
	present an implementation in the SHaRK operating system.},
