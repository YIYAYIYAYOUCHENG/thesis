\chapter{Acknowledgments}
After six months' efforts, I am concluding this thesis,
which is the most devoted work I have ever done. Great 
appreciation to my thesis supervisor, Giuseppe Lipari.
It's amazing to work with you. Your involvment keeps
delicate balance that the problems I meet (in thesis 
and life) can be solved and my potential for inpdendent 
and creative thinking is highly motivated. There are too 
many stupid, unrelated and weird opinions that I have 
told you. However, I could always get positive and 
beneficial feedbacks. 
Thanks to my supervisor Luigi Palopoli in Trento.
At the early days after I came to Italy, I was confused. 
You helped me be confident. 
I enjoyed the last two years' time. I met these professors, 
colleagues and friends that make my life special. I am not 
going to list every name. I sincerely thank you all. 
Dear Liang, because of you, I am the luckiest person in 
the world. 
Baba mama, I love you!
